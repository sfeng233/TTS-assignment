( vogue_1097 "And it felt like comfort, even a sort of relief." )
( vogue_1098 "No landscape, no minefields, no reintroductions needed." )
( vogue_1099 "As though it doesn't change in different situations." )
( vogue_1100 "And often, I think, pigeonholing yourself as an introvert in particular can become a self fulfilling prophecy." )
( vogue_1101 "If you tell yourself you get exhausted by big social events, then you're likely to feel exhausted." )
( vogue_1102 "There is a lot going on in the landscape, if you gaze upon it long enough." )
( vogue_1103 " Running long stretches without a break for eighteen months hadn't guarded against anxiety or low mood." )
( vogue_1104 "Instead, I was sat on the couch feeling diabolical and let down. " )

( vogue_1114 "These experiences have made me realise that I, too, have been wearing the introvert label as a protective cloak." )
( vogue_1115 "It's very difficult to know where to begin when talking about pronouns." )
( vogue_1116 "However, it's an unskippable part of the conversation; we can't advance to day two without going through day one." )
( vogue_1117 "Indeed, correcting yourself need be no more complicated than correcting yourself after getting someone's name wrong." )
