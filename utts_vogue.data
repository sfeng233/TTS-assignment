( vogue_0313 "And then slowly, the pain, which slides into the room and there settles sleepily against me." )
( vogue_0314 "A muffled sensation, a quick sadness and the terrible sense that I am trapped, again." )
( vogue_0315 "MRIs revealed a shadowy area on my brain, the result of either mini strokes or migraines." )
( vogue_0316 "While introducing myself to Dr Munglani, on Zoom from his home in Cambridge, I paused." )
( vogue_0317 "Is that ... a glass of wine, I asked, gently." )
( vogue_0318 "And well, I don't think she's putting it on." )
( vogue_0319 "Historically, to be a woman in pain is to grin tightly and bear it." )
( vogue_0320 "Over the course of my conversation with Dr Munglani, two things surprised me." )
( vogue_0321 "Despite MRI scanners, Munglani says, None of us can feel another person's pain." )
( vogue_0322 "So, in a way, pain is what the patient says it is. It is, he stresses, not a disease." )
( vogue_0323 "It is part of the normal human experience." )
( vogue_0324 "Up to fifty per cent of the population are suffering some sort of pain it's a survival mechanism." )
( vogue_0325 "Pain has been around since human beings developed consciousness." )
( vogue_0326 "But since pain is a protective influence, what we do is work out when it becomes excessive." )
( vogue_0327 "What he does is first work out how intrusive a pain is, then decides whether to intervene." )
( vogue_0328 "What's trickier is to find a balance that also allows the patient to function." )
( vogue_0329 "That's a little more of an art. Take the opioid epidemic that has gripped America for almost three decades." )
( vogue_0330 "His job instead is to remove their suffering." )
( vogue_0331 "While pain may be a protective process, suffering, he says, is unhelpful." )
( vogue_0332 "What else do people get wrong when we talk about pain?" )
( vogue_0333 "They think patients who get pain are weak. The word itself originates from the Latin for punishment, poena." )
( vogue_0334 "And some people believe it's punishment for something they've done in the past." )
( vogue_0335 "I say, 'No, life's a bugger." )
( vogue_0336 "So let us help you.' There's no blame in pain. He grins." )
( vogue_0337 "It's recognised now that pain has biopsychosocial influences, meaning a person's feelings shape their experience of it." )
( vogue_0338 "What's becoming clear, too, is that doctors' perception of patients shapes how they manage them." )
( vogue_0339 "White patients and men are more likely than Black patients and women to be treated with opioids." )

( vogue_0345 "Corns read case studies of people with pain asymbolia, who report pains that aren't unpleasant." )
( vogue_0346 "She became convinced that philosophy should engage with the practical side of pain treatment." )
( vogue_0347 "Scientists and clinicians have made the same mistake of oversimplifying pain that many philosophers have made, she tells me." )
( vogue_0348 "We err whenever we take pain to be a unified entity appropriately targeted for medical treatment." )
( vogue_0349 "There is no single pain system, pain receptor or pain area in the brain." )
( vogue_0350 "Instead, we need to recognise pain for the complex and diverse class of episodes that it is." )
( vogue_0351 "Unlike other ailments, a pain treatment is not a clean process." )
( vogue_0352 "Patients in pain are not one thing." )
( vogue_0353 "Like treatment for pain, Corns realised, conversation about it can be improved by recognising its complexity." )

( vogue_0357 "What does the way the world treats pain tell us about who we are today?" )
( vogue_0358 "Wretched. I'd never noticed that before." )
( vogue_0359 "Or is there a part of me that identifies with the ache, that thinks complaining about it shows weakness?" )
( vogue_0360 "I'd been feeling pain for decades." )
( vogue_0361 "Why had it taken me so long to try and understand it too?" )
( vogue_0362 "From six April, you will be able to get a no fault divorce in the UK." )

( vogue_0364 "When a marriage breaks up, blame is usually present already." )
( vogue_0365 "Blame on the person who didn't try harder to make it work." )
( vogue_0366 "I've heard people say it was nobody's fault in movies and books, but very rarely in real life." )
( vogue_0367 "It might fuel you through those initial awful weeks and months, but it's not a good feeling long term." )
( vogue_0368 "When I got divorced nearly a decade ago, I found the process stoked all these negative feelings." )
( vogue_0369 "How could it not, when there's a sanctioned list of reasons to get divorced?" )
( vogue_0370 "How does that not compound the blame?" )
( vogue_0371 "And I strongly resented having to give a reason at all." )
( vogue_0372 "It certainly might've prevented a lot of acrimony and hostility had these outdated rules been scrapped back then." )
( vogue_0373 "I know that a no fault divorce won't eliminate all the pain or messiness of a split." )
( vogue_0374 "Nor will it stop financial wrangling or custody battles." )
( vogue_0375 "But I still think it's a huge step forward." )
( vogue_0376 "My God, imagine letting unhappy people stuck in failed marriages separate and move on?" )
( vogue_0377 "That was enough to deal with, without the intrusive paperwork." )
( vogue_0378 "A couple of weeks ago, I went for an appointment with my psychiatrist." )
( vogue_0379 "For five years, I had regular talk therapy with a therapist near me named Gladys." )
( vogue_0380 "With Gladys, I unpicked everything in my history, from minute semi memories to full catastrophes." )
( vogue_0381 "I realised that some things I thought dead and buried were still causing me trouble." )
( vogue_0382 "She was more than a listener, though; she was a sage, too." )
( vogue_0383 "That single hour a week to just completely vent and be safely vulnerable is so incredibly valuable." )
( vogue_0384 "Sometimes we need that spotlight for a little longer to make sense of the twisty stuff." )
( vogue_0385 "It's not a particularly natural thing to meet a stranger and lay everything bare." )
( vogue_0386 "There were times, even three to four years in, when I questioned what I could share with her." )
( vogue_0387 "We spoke about it afterwards and I was reassured, but it highlighted the strangeness of our relationship." )
( vogue_0388 "She knew everything about me, and I knew nothing about her." )
( vogue_0389 "Every angle of my anxieties was covered, and I was often distraught in her office." )
( vogue_0390 "But our work wasn't purely reactionary, either." )
( vogue_0391 "A huge component of the final years of our time together was discussing privilege and discrimination." )
( vogue_0392 "In my experience, I went to see Gladys because I didn't know what was wrong." )
( vogue_0393 "We agreed on a schedule of six more sessions, and as each session passed, I felt a growing awkwardness." )
( vogue_0394 "But I think I understand it now." )
( vogue_0395 "I'm hilariously over confident in the advice I give, and ferociously defensive when my friends speak badly about themselves." )
( vogue_0396 "I wasn't really sure what was happening, how to properly describe it." )
( vogue_0397 "We were friends, but only partially." )
( vogue_0398 "She was my friend, but I was her client." )
( vogue_0399 "She knew an enormous amount about me, and I knew almost nothing about her." )
( vogue_0400 "It felt uncomfortably imbalanced, and I worried about how things would end." )
( vogue_0401 "I can't think of a comparable situation, really." )
( vogue_0402 "When I came to her thinking I knew exactly what I needed to feel better, she offered an alternative." )
( vogue_0403 "With her help, I began to cope with my fear of uncertainty and impermanence." )
( vogue_0404 "Ultimately, it did end with a hug, and some tears from both of us." )
( vogue_0405 "For most of my life, I disliked tattoos." )
( vogue_0406 "I wasn't judging, they just weren't for me." )
( vogue_0407 "Clear, minimalist, healthy skin, I decided, was my personal aesthetic ideal." )
( vogue_0408 "I wanted to minimise anything that got in its way." )
( vogue_0409 "It's not about the pain, but more like regaining something that has been lost." )
( vogue_0410 "Activists have been using social media to powerful effect to intentionally revive these traditions." )
( vogue_0411 "As a TV journalist, I could wear colours, but only those deemed compatible with the corporate branding." )
( vogue_0412 "My jewellery, accessories and natural hair textures were all the subject of discussion by male managers." )
( vogue_0413 "If I had wanted a tattoo, anything visible would have been out of the question." )
( vogue_0414 "This was not without its small rebellions, though my initial forays into bodily adornment produced dismal results." )
( vogue_0415 "Later I learnt these guns were designed for tagging cattle's ears, not human cartilage." )
( vogue_0416 "It was early confirmation that I wasn't going to design my body to please anyone." )
( vogue_0417 "Like many of us, what I did know about tattoos was filtered through a colonial lens." )
( vogue_0418 "This history is close to home." )
( vogue_0419 "But I have never seen any evidence of it in my own family." )
( vogue_0420 "Across Africa, many in our grandmothers' generation had tattoos." )
( vogue_0421 "But in our parents' generation, tattooing just stopped." )
( vogue_0422 "Black women have been particularly affected by the loss of these customs." )
( vogue_0423 "But the sexualisation of modern tattoos bears little relation to these traditions." )
( vogue_0424 "If you look up #blackinkedwomen, you will find one style that is very hyper sexualised, Horn says." )
( vogue_0425 "That's fine, but it's very one dimensional the assumption is that women are getting tattooed for other people's gaze." )
( vogue_0426 "Turning forty last year, I began to think about the ageing process and how we as women respond." )
( vogue_0427 "I spoke to friends who said I should get plastic surgery, but that just wasn't me." )
( vogue_0428 "I love that our most powerful deity is female, in recognition of the ability to give life, Okobi says." )
( vogue_0429 "And I started thinking about the fact my skin was marked by giving life." )
( vogue_0430 "Why would I want to erase this powerful thing that I had the honour and privilege of doing?" )
( vogue_0431 "I wanted something that embodies that." )
( vogue_0432 "I see it as a return to savagery, she says." )
( vogue_0433 "I find my tattoo beautiful too." )
( vogue_0434 "But more importantly, every time I look at my hand, I feel newly connected to their story." )
( vogue_0435 "Last summer, I made the decision to shave my head." )
( vogue_0436 "I was twenty five, and it was life changing." )
( vogue_0437 "The following day I woke with a lightness that I couldn't remember experiencing." )
( vogue_0438 "Walking through the park feeling the wind fly over my exposed head was a sensation I will never forget." )
( vogue_0439 "Yet the beginning of my story, of how I developed alopecia, is hazy, suppressed by years of denial." )
( vogue_0440 "I can recall the panic on her face and the shock in her voice." )
( vogue_0441 "Suddenly, though, my appearance was everything." )
( vogue_0442 "It was all that defined me to others." )
( vogue_0443 "People were either embarrassed and pitying, or cruel." )
( vogue_0444 "Alopecia affects about two in every one,zero people in Britain." )
( vogue_0445 "There is no evidence of a cure and no way to predict the hair loss." )
( vogue_0446 "I was terrified and didn't know what to do." )
( vogue_0447 "Ashamed of my appearance, I felt I had no choice but to wear a wig." )
( vogue_0448 "It was a very unsettling experience and, at ten years old, it made me incredibly uncomfortable." )
( vogue_0449 "My mum told me I looked like Twiggy in a bid to make me feel better." )
( vogue_0450 "The reality was that even that word wig made me wince: it felt so old fashioned and unglamorous." )
( vogue_0451 "It still makes me cringe to say it today." )
( vogue_0452 "I came to accept that's the way I would be treated by others." )
( vogue_0453 "I would be genuinely surprised when people would let on they could see the elephant in the room." )
( vogue_0454 "Somehow in all this, I struggled to accept that I needed to talk." )
( vogue_0455 "In a world where visual beauty is so often equated with happiness and success, I believed I was worthless." )
( vogue_0456 "As a teenager, I was judged every day both by myself and others." )
( vogue_0457 "I resisted intimacy and refused to have honest conversations about what was going on in my life." )
( vogue_0458 "I was defiant that I didn't need relationships, that I was enough on my own." )
( vogue_0459 "It was easier than feeling rejected." )
( vogue_0460 "Of course, I now see my obsessive work ethic for what it was: another form of controlling behaviour." )
( vogue_0461 "For the first time, I felt supported outside of my family." )
( vogue_0462 "My love and talent for photography also strengthened." )
( vogue_0463 "I had always loved fashion but felt short changed when I couldn't have a hairstyle to suit my outfits." )
( vogue_0464 "In Japan, I wore my long, chestnut brown hair; in Berlin I opted for a shiny red bob." )
( vogue_0465 "It felt like taking on an alter ego." )
( vogue_0466 "It was yoga, though, that would prove to be the catalyst for real transformation." )
( vogue_0467 "As a photographer, I am always the observer, not the observed." )

( vogue_0474 "There's the good stuff: the thrilling first dates and romantic proposals, the birthday parties and anniversaries." )
( vogue_0475 "And the bad stuff too: the terrible first dates and awkward break ups, the excruciating conversations and unbearable tension." )
( vogue_0476 "Restaurants are the collision of public and private, the scene of intimate discussions interrupted or overheard." )
( vogue_0477 "Or we went, but only as tag alongs when our parents couldn't get childcare." )
( vogue_0478 "To some this act of ventriloquism might've been impressive even sexy?" )
( vogue_0479 ", but to me it was cringeworthy." )
( vogue_0480 "His affectation gave me the ick and from then on, our romance was doomed." )
( vogue_0481 "Restaurants became a bigger part of my life when I turned eighteen and my parents separated." )
( vogue_0482 "In these restaurants I discovered a new side to my dad, a side I hadn't had access to before." )
( vogue_0483 "The warm greetings from waiting staff where he was a regular." )
( vogue_0484 "The humorous anecdotes about his life growing up." )
( vogue_0485 "That's the thing about restaurants: there's almost always some kind of power dynamic, no matter who you're with." )
( vogue_0486 "It's the tightrope of chivalry when on a first date, and the unsaid rules after someone's treated you." )
( vogue_0487 "I was not to pester my dad about his drinking; I was not to complain about problems at work." )
( vogue_0488 "I thought very little of these dynamics until lockdown arrived, and it was no longer possible to visit restaurants." )
( vogue_0489 "The way we dress, the things we order, what we say and don't say." )
( vogue_0490 "And maybe we have taken restaurants for granted, so entrenched in our city lives they've become." )
( vogue_0491 "It's been two years now of on and off lockdowns, of QR codes and exposure alerts and shivering on terraces." )

( vogue_0955 "As someone who binged both seasons of Euphoria in recent weeks alone, I found Kat singularly captivating." )
( vogue_0956 "Even in a fictional friend group that includes Rue Zendaya and Jules Hunter Schafer, Ferreira/Kat arguably stole season one." )
( vogue_0957 "See also: commanding them to fulfil her Amazon wishlist." )
( vogue_0958 "So was the scene that immediately followed in season one's Kat centric episode three." )
( vogue_0959 "You look different, Kat's science partner and eventual love interest Ethan Austin Abrams said." )
( vogue_0960 "It was about the blurring of online and real identities and how each inevitably spills into the other." )

( vogue_1013 "I was in pain and in shock after a fluke accident had completely upended my life." )
( vogue_1014 "For months afterwards, I would often find myself totally overwhelmed scared, anxious, depressed and alone." )
( vogue_1015 "But I didn't want anyone's pity and I was in no mood to be the latest trending topic." )
( vogue_1016 "I believed that I had the strength to handle the situation in only one way." )
( vogue_1017 "And that way was to lie." )
( vogue_1018 "And lie to everybody including myself." )

( vogue_1029 "Dr Kevin Serror my hero would examine my skin as it began to regenerate." )
( vogue_1030 "He and the rest of the burns team were wonderful and caring but they were also extremely professional." )
( vogue_1031 "I had burnt almost the entire front of my body mostly first and second degree burns." )
( vogue_1032 "Skin grafts might be necessary, I was warned, and discolouration and scarring were strong possibilities." )
( vogue_1033 "I stumbled my way through those early days in a pain filled fog." )
( vogue_1034 "The only thing that my mind could focus on was the excruciating, non stop agony." )
( vogue_1035 "I had just one other obsession: I was determined to keep the news from others." )
( vogue_1036 "Even my family were kept in the dark." )
( vogue_1037 "Perhaps my most effective ally in my disinformation campaign was the coronavirus." )
( vogue_1038 "Just a month earlier, during Paris Fashion Week, I had walked down the runway to cheers." )
( vogue_1039 "Now, all I could focus on was how much damage the flames had done to my looks." )
( vogue_1040 "That depression pushed me to escalate my lies." )
( vogue_1041 "I turned off the Zoom camera." )
( vogue_1042 "But still, all I could focus on was the changes." )
( vogue_1043 "Those pledged to silence kept their word." )
( vogue_1044 "I thoroughly mastered the situation, overseeing and editing every tiny detail of each house shooting, moment and presentation." )
( vogue_1045 "Even my summer holiday photos, posted from a Grecian paradise, were a lie." )
( vogue_1046 "Why was I hiding the truth?" )
( vogue_1047 "My decision to work so hard to mislead so many confused those who know me well." )
( vogue_1048 "I'd always been proudly open about my life and my feelings." )
( vogue_1049 "And somehow, miraculously, that work as my therapy cliché actually proved to be true for me." )

( vogue_1056 "You can actually spot a bit of that new outlook in some of my latest designs." )
( vogue_1057 "It's unfair that the more you like someone, the less attractive you are around them." )
( vogue_1058 "I fancy this friend of mine a lot, so my behaviour towards him is particularly weird." )
( vogue_1059 "I invited him to a party and then uninvited him, then invited him again." )
( vogue_1060 "I didn't think there was much wrong with this behaviour bar my execution of it." )
( vogue_1061 "She adopted this very intense, combative flirting style." )
( vogue_1062 "She told him she didn't want anything serious." )
( vogue_1063 "Kamari said it was cool because he didn't either." )
( vogue_1064 "When Kamari said hi, Abbey pretended to not remember who he was." )
( vogue_1065 "You know I know you, he said." )
( vogue_1066 "Not that well, she responded, rolling her eyes, running her tongue over her teeth." )
( vogue_1067 "It ended, eventually, and when it did, Kamari started flirting with Roxy." )
( vogue_1068 "This second girl behaves completely differently." )
( vogue_1069 "Kamari made shrimp and grits for Roxy and he looked so nervous when she ate it." )
( vogue_1070 "It's easy to be around you." )
( vogue_1071 "It's shit always being the girl that men don't take seriously." )
( vogue_1072 "Someone to flirt with and not to wife." )
( vogue_1073 "The starter before the main course." )
( vogue_1074 "I wasn't like this with my friend before." )
( vogue_1075 "He told me to keep going because he liked hearing the things that managed to calm me down." )
( vogue_1076 "I asked him about how decorating his room was going, told him his top looked nice." )
( vogue_1077 "I guess somewhere along the way I just stopped feeling like myself was enough." )
( vogue_1078 "But I'm sure he could smell the desperation on me like I could watching Abbey." )
( vogue_1079 "In pretending not to care I only showed how much I really did." )
( vogue_1080 "I'm going to apologise to him for making things awkward." )
( vogue_1081 "Like 'I started to develop feelings I don't think you're into it which is fine." )
( vogue_1082 "I just want to draw a line under it now.'" )
( vogue_1083 "Do you have to tell him?" )
( vogue_1084 "Can't you just draw a line under it yourself?" )
( vogue_1085 "What if he didn't even realise and now you've just embarrassed yourself?" )
( vogue_1086 "I think I need to open myself up to the possibility of hurt, I told her." )
( vogue_1087 "I think that will stop other bigger hurts from happening." )
( vogue_1088 "That last thing I said made me think about when I got my first Covid jab." )
( vogue_1089 "It really stung, and my arm felt like it was filled with concrete afterwards." )
( vogue_1090 "I barely felt it at all that second time, just a small scratch on the surface of my skin." )
( vogue_1091 "But I did drop the act." )
( vogue_1092 "I saw him at a party and told him that I really enjoyed the photos he'd been taking recently." )
( vogue_1093 "I haven't seen him again for a little while." )
( vogue_1094 "I looked up to the sky and said give me all you've got." )
( vogue_1095 "We may earn a commission if you buy something from any affiliate links on our site." )
( vogue_1096 "There's a lot that's aggravating about Inventing Anna." )
( vogue_1097 "The fact that most of the episodes are about twenty minutes longer than necessary." )
( vogue_1098 "The accent dear God, the accent." )
( vogue_1099 "Except for all the parts that are totally made up." )
( vogue_1100 "Rachel was always there when stuff was fun, Anna's most loyal friend Neff later tells Vivian." )
( vogue_1101 "Everything she wore was Anna's; I think she was trying to be Anna." )
( vogue_1102 "It's the beginning of a portrayal that makes Rachel out to be simultaneously vacuous and materialistic, naive and snobby." )
( vogue_1103 "Except that none of that actually happened." )
( vogue_1104 "Delvey never once bought Williams an item of clothing." )
( vogue_1105 "Williams has never watched Keeping Up with the Kardashians." )
( vogue_1106 "And Rachel is no wide eyed ingenue dazzled by Sorokin's tacky displays of wealth and gaggle of celebrity hangers on." )
( vogue_1107 "Like the ever faithful Neff, at various moments, the Vanity Fair employee held a position somewhere between friend and staff." )
( vogue_1108 "Yet Rachel never stuck Vanity Fair with the bill, instead transferring the debt to her personal card." )
( vogue_1109 "And while American Express did eventually forgive the charge, that only happened after Delvey's trial had wrapped up." )
( vogue_1110 "At that point, I realised the story would be coming out with or without me." )
( vogue_1111 "It felt important to tell it in my words." )
( vogue_1112 "Her reputation's coup de grâce in Inventing Anna's crazy narrative arc?" )
( vogue_1113 "Delvey herself received more than $three hundred,zero for her participation in Inventing Anna." )
( vogue_1114 "But I really can't do anything about it, being in here." )
( vogue_1115 "It would be more understandable if reimagining Rachel's character added to the story's resonance in a meaningful way." )
( vogue_1116 "As for Inventing Anna's treatment of the fictional Rachel's quest for justice?" )
( vogue_1117 "It gets dangerously close to endorsing the sort of logic used to shame the Tinder Swindler's victims." )
( vogue_1118 "Would you doubt her when she said a wire would be coming through imminently?" )
( vogue_1119 "Or would you just hand over your goddamn AmEx?" )
( vogue_1120 "Perhaps the fictional Rachel ends up grateful for her life being turned upside down by Delvey." )
( vogue_1121 "I can confirm that the real life Rachel is decidedly more ambivalent about the situation." )
( vogue_1122 "In the end, though, there are worse crimes than gaucheness grand larceny included." )
( vogue_1123 "Instead, it gets the two confused right from the start." )
( vogue_1124 "Email has been fraught since the earliest, perhaps darkest, days of the pandemic." )
( vogue_1125 "First came the loaded I hope this finds you well sometimes punctuated with the caveat: as well as possible!." )
( vogue_1126 "Then, stay safe emerged as a timely sign off, replacing the ubiquitous best." )
( vogue_1127 "The inherently cold email has perhaps never felt more intentionally kind." )
( vogue_1128 "Would you kindly share a class roster? one parent replied all re: addressing the aforementioned Valentines." )
( vogue_1129 "It feels important to acknowledge that." )
( vogue_1130 "When our team is pitching, we tread lightly and are genuinely sensitive to the overload." )
( vogue_1131 "Crystal explains that in context, the word can indeed read as ironic." )
( vogue_1132 "'Kindly leave the field,' he said." )
( vogue_1133 "Still, I welcome gentleness and kindness to the stress minefield that is my inbox." )
( vogue_1134 "It's an impulse now, an instinct that I expect I'll find difficult to drop when normality fully returns." )
( vogue_1135 "And its effects have a backwards lean, too." )
( vogue_1136 "Perhaps it's unrealistic to try to establish a new normal in such weird times." )
( vogue_1137 "I know it wasn't working for me, at least." )
( vogue_1138 "One of the worst, most destructive symptoms of my condition has been my tendency towards catastrophic thinking." )
( vogue_1139 "It's an expression of anxiety, I suppose, but it can be debilitating." )
( vogue_1140 "The phone isn't being answered because the person I'm calling has died, and this can happen in seconds." )
( vogue_1141 "An example: following his knee replacement surgery, my dad collapsed in his recovery room." )
( vogue_1142 "Alarms were sounding and people started pouring into his room." )
( vogue_1143 "Dad's fine, by the way, his blood pressure dropped, making him dizzy." )
( vogue_1144 "For some reason, these two instances provoked almost identical symptoms of panic for me." )
( vogue_1145 "The same icy blood, nausea, pins and needles over my entire body, hyperventilation and inability to speak." )
( vogue_1146 "And yet I was incapable of doing so." )
( vogue_1147 "I've thought about whether this could be a form of over empathising, but that feels inaccurate." )
( vogue_1148 "Intellectually, I know the difference between a threat that is mine, and one that isn't." )
( vogue_1149 "But my body hasn't been able to take that on board." )
( vogue_1150 "Almost as if the knowledge of the threat is threatening enough, even if it will never come near me." )
( vogue_1151 "But it does follow a pattern of catastrophic thinking." )
( vogue_1152 "Following the Brexit vote, I was terrified that there would be a rise in xenophobic attacks, which there were." )
( vogue_1153 "Why not just turn off the news?" )
( vogue_1154 "Why not just put on a movie and ignore it?" )
( vogue_1155 "And then, suddenly, it has at least tentatively." )
( vogue_1156 "World events and there have been a lot, haven't there?" )
( vogue_1157 "Well, we've had a global catastrophe, haven't we." )
( vogue_1158 "We've experienced a global event which has, to varying degrees of severity, touched everyone on the planet." )
( vogue_1159 "And I wonder if this has provided something of a hard reset to my brain." )
( vogue_1160 "Not the worst, but a worst, has happened." )
( vogue_1161 "In it, Justine, played by Kirsten Dunst, experiences a depression which floors her." )
( vogue_1162 "Maybe, when the worst does come, I'll actually be OK?" )
( vogue_1163 "It's not been quite as cinematic or grandiose as that, but I think there's something in the idea." )
( vogue_1164 "When the pandemic took hold of the world, it was an inescapable reality." )
( vogue_1165 "There was no option to turn off the news and ignore it." )
( vogue_1166 "I suppose a key element here was that this, finally, was a moment of unanimous freakout, of global consequence." )
( vogue_1167 "But I can claim it as a notable personal development." )
( vogue_1168 "Over the years of panic, I've sacrificed my effectiveness as a support." )
( vogue_1169 "My worst heartbreak followed a relationship that never quite happened." )
( vogue_1170 "Joshua and I met through a friend." )
( vogue_1171 "I was twenty four and, as we tend to in our mid twenties, I hated myself." )
( vogue_1172 "With him, though, I found I hated myself a little less." )
( vogue_1173 "Perhaps it was never even him I was interested in." )
( vogue_1174 "I was certain he was falling in love with me." )
( vogue_1175 "Plans began to unfold, with an imagined future as exciting as the present." )
( vogue_1176 "The colour of my life changed." )
( vogue_1177 "And then he cancelled a date, right after I'd washed my hair." )
( vogue_1178 "Eventually he did call: he was back with his ex girlfriend." )
( vogue_1179 "I will remember her name until the day I die." )
( vogue_1180 "I was polite, and then after I hung up I cried myself sick." )
( vogue_1181 "This was not my first heartbreak." )
( vogue_1182 "Perhaps it hurt the most because I had invented a future I never even got to touch." )
( vogue_1183 "Love or whatever that was doesn't make any sense." )
( vogue_1184 "It is magic, and heartbreak is the price we pay." )
( vogue_1185 "Five years later, I would publish a book called Heartsick." )
( vogue_1186 "For twelve months I closely studied heartbreak through the lives of three subjects." )
( vogue_1187 "I once spoke to a man well into his sixties whose heart had been broken at fourteen." )
( vogue_1188 "For some of the subjects I interviewed, years had passed." )
( vogue_1189 "I learnt that heartbreak is not a brand of grief we respect." )
( vogue_1190 "And finally, there is profound value in heartbreak." )
( vogue_1191 "And isn't that the point of it all?" )
( vogue_1192 "The language of heartbreak becomes a gift we are able to offer those currently experiencing it." )
( vogue_1193 "Perhaps there is nothing more beautiful than that." )
( vogue_1194 "Let's call it Option one, shall we?" )
( vogue_1195 "Option three brings us back, as all things worth their salt do, to Sex and the City." )
( vogue_1196 "At least in the early stages, before your friends know your person's name." )
( vogue_1197 "Sure, it sounds kind of unrequited and sad in a way, but who cares?" )
( vogue_1198 "Go forth and figure out what works for you, beloveds!" )
( vogue_1199 "I've always wanted to have kids." )
( vogue_1200 "It's always been a dream but, as a lesbian, I grew up wondering if it might be harder." )
( vogue_1201 "In sport, we were encouraged to have our eggs frozen." )
( vogue_1202 "I didn't know at the time that this wasn't the norm for women outside of sport." )
( vogue_1203 "Then I met my partner, Ella Baig." )
( vogue_1204 "Who was going to carry the baby?" )
( vogue_1205 "Whose egg were we going to use?" )
( vogue_1206 "Nicola Adams with her partner Ella Baig." )
( vogue_1207 "In twenty nineteen, we started our fertility journey." )
( vogue_1208 "We had a lot of appointments and did a lot of tests before the actual process started." )
( vogue_1209 "It's something that's easy to diagnose with blood tests and treat with medication." )
( vogue_1210 "Our first attempt failed and Ella had a miscarriage." )
( vogue_1211 "At that point, we decided to change clinics." )
( vogue_1212 "Our new fertility doctor had Ella see a thyroid specialist immediately who put her on medication." )
( vogue_1213 "I would encourage people going through IVF to speak to multiple doctors and get different opinions." )
( vogue_1214 "After this, you have multiple ultrasounds to make sure that everything is going to plan." )
( vogue_1215 "We had two failed attempts in total." )
( vogue_1216 "I was also more upset for Ella as she was the one going through the process physically." )
( vogue_1217 "You don't really know what to say or do you just have to be supportive." )
( vogue_1218 "Then, a few months ago, we found out that Ella was pregnant again." )
( vogue_1219 "She's now in her second trimester." )
( vogue_1220 "I'm so happy, but it's also been emotional." )
( vogue_1221 "I was so excited to share the news with friends and family." )
( vogue_1222 "They've been incredibly supportive throughout our journey and their faces lit up when we told them." )
( vogue_1223 "It feels even more real now that Ella is beginning to show." )
( vogue_1224 "We want to be the best parents we can be." )
( vogue_1225 "All of this needs to be spoken about more widely." )
( vogue_1226 "People need to be educated about this process so that they're not going into it completely blind." )
( vogue_1227 "The information is out there but we really had to dig for it." )
( vogue_1228 "It shouldn't be this hard to access." )
( vogue_1229 "We hope that at least one person finds solace in our story." )
( vogue_1230 "If you're a same sex couple going through this chapter of your lives, know that you're not alone." )
( vogue_1231 "Ella and I would like to have more kids after this." )
( vogue_1232 "Next time around, I think the process will be a lot easier for us." )
( vogue_1233 "We now know what to expect and will be prepared for whatever happens, good or bad." )
( vogue_1234 "We'll say, You have no idea how much we wanted you!" )
( vogue_1235 "At the end of the activity, I realised I hadn't been paired up." )
( vogue_1236 "You're just very compatible, Hannah, the boy sitting next to me quipped, You could probably marry any of us." )
( vogue_1237 "This fact tends to surprise people." )
( vogue_1238 "A very poor cocktail for making sensible, life altering commitments." )

( vogue_1386 "In return for his involuntary listening ear I offer less than nothing." )

( vogue_1399 "And just like that, And Just Like That ... has ended." )
( vogue_1400 "I've mentioned this before, but who among us could have predicted Carrie urinating in a diet Snapple bottle?" )

( vogue_1418 "I hope all of this comes true." )
( vogue_1419 "I hope Samantha comes back scatting double entendres next to an upright bass." )

( vogue_1426 "January, even if it doesn't have more days than say, July, crawls by." )
( vogue_1427 "Grey, cold, dark and bereft of the twinkly lights which guide us towards the promise of festive fun." )

( vogue_1436 "But recently, I've wondered whether I should be trying to persuade others of the benefits behind my choice." )
( vogue_1437 "Awkwardly, my grandfather was a farmer, and ate meat at every meal with the fervour of a TV evangelist." )
( vogue_1438 "I never told him about my decision; I think he'd have rather not felt the disappointment." )
( vogue_1439 "Land is deforested and greenhouse gases mushroom." )
( vogue_1440 "I do it because I cannot bear the idea of killing animals for my dinner." )
( vogue_1441 "That cow looked into my eyes all those years ago, licked my hand, and I was done." )
( vogue_1442 "But over the years, being a vegetarian has gotten easier and easier." )

( vogue_1448 "And yet so many of us still eat meat." )
( vogue_1449 "Not on special occasions, or only when carefully sourcing where it came from, but casually and frequently." )
( vogue_1450 "Add between fifty one billion and one hundred and sixty billion farmed fish to that number and it's hard not to reel." )
( vogue_1451 "But I think perhaps I might lose the apologies I make for not eating it." )
( vogue_1452 "When my husband met me, he ate meat regularly." )
( vogue_1453 "Now he doesn't, since I do most of the cooking and he realises how little he misses it." )
( vogue_1454 "Sure, he might have a steak or sausage once or twice a year, but not more." )
( vogue_1455 "It has, he assures me, been easy." )
( vogue_1456 "Maybe what I'm really working towards here is going vegan myself." )
( vogue_1457 "Maybe I'll try vegan February and see how I go." )
